"A baseline model is presented by **Muller et al** which simulates the infection level and growth rate for a given number of random tests administered equally across the whole population. The model incorporates an infection rate boundary that will trigger an internvetion (an easing intervention will increase the infection and growth rate, and a restricting intervention will reduce them)[[1]](#1).

My goal is to revise the model to manage various numbers of tests and levels of intervention across three distinct age groups in the population, in order to model the infection rate for each group under different circumstances"
